# Intro to ShareLaTeX

## Garret Christensen

[ShareLaTeX](http://www.sharelatex.com) is a web-based LaTeX editor. It's similar to [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com), and the two will in fact merge at some point.
The main reason I can think of to not like LaTeX is that it's a pain to work collaboratively since you don't have Track Changes.
But now you do!

1. Create an account.
2. Create a document.
3. Compile it.
4. Edit to include an image. (Upload the file)
5. Share with a neighbor
6. Turn on track changes.
7. Edit simultaneously.

Voila!
